# Kraken-Image-Logger
Kraken Image Logger is THE ONLY working image logger. <br/>
For whoever cares, this image logger exploits a subdomain with <br/>
expired CNAME that has roblox cookies passed on to it. <br/>
Therefore when a user opens the image you sent him <br/>
(which is hosted on the exploited domain by us for free) <br/>
you will be able to retrieve his cookie via webhook 
# Installation 
If you know anything about compiling, you can compile all the files for yourself. <br/>
